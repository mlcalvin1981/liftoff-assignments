# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My Project will be a web application for a small business cleaning company.

This application will allow users to get price estimates for professional property cleanings, with no obligation to buy 
or register an account. The goal of this project is to have a hassle-free, efficient, and user-friendly experience for 
our commercial clients. After the user receives their estimate, we will streamline the entire rest of the process, from 
registering an account to booking their appointment via our calendar feature.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application.

Admin login: The business owner and staff will be able to create accounts with admin status, to modify and update 
appointment dates/times.

Calendar access: Users will be able to view and set the ideal appointment time/date for cleanings.

Txt message confirmation: Users will have the peace of mind knowing that their appointment has been booked for the 
time/date of their choice.

Testimonials: Users are encouraged to share with others, and their feedback is greatly appreciated. Admins will have the
option to moderate this page, if need be.

### Technologies
At this moment, Technologies will include: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to implement the calendar feature into our application. This will be new to me, as a developer,
but I am very excited. I truly believe that this will be the best part of our application, and the most crucial for a 
small business owner. Providing punctuality and an easy user experience, is what we will depend on.

The goal is to have our users see a calendar (week/month) with specific days/times either booked or open. If the user 
successfully finds an open spot, we would like to also provide a txt message confirmation (I will also have to learn how
to do this).
